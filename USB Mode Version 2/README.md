## About

The USB Mode macro is a community driven solution that enables USB Passthrough for Cisco Room devices that do not natively support this feature.

USB Passthrough is a feature, found on products like the Webex Room Kit Mini and the Webex Desk Pro, that allows you to take advantage the device's rich microphone(s), intelligent camera(s) and powerful speaker(s) as a sophisticated webcamera for various 3rd party software clients.

To better illustrate how this macro works, please click on the video demo below to see USB mode in action

## Before you begin
USB Mode is only 1 flavor of the USB Passthrough solution. Many new Room Devices support this natively and we recommend you work with the native tools built into the product if available.

Check out the [USB Mode Endpoint Compatibility Matrix](#usb-mode-endpoint-compatibility-matrix) below to see which USB solution is right for you.

## How does the script work
While USB mode is enabled, your Room Device's base configuration is stored in memory and then reconfigured to send Microphone Data out the Line Output of your device and your Main Source video out the last video output connection(Model Dependent); these feeds are fed into a compatible USB capture card(See docs for details). 

The room devices native UI elements, such as calling, sharing, meetings etc, are hidden, your presentation is started and the device is placed into an infinite Do Not Disturb(DND) Loop.

These elements are hidden and DND is enabled to prevent calling out or in while USB mode is enabled in order to prevent confusing the user as to what the system is doing.

When USB mode is Disabled, your system will show all Native UI Elements, disengage infinite DND and recover your system's base configuration for full Webex and SIP use.

## USB Mode Endpoint Compatibility Matrix
### Key
- Native USB: Devices that have USB Passthrough built into their hardware. No need for a macro and highly recommended ðŸ˜ƒ
- Native Inogeni: Native OS support for USB mode, no macro required. Inogeni 4KX-Plus Capture device required. (Not currently available)
- Macro 1-3: Original USB Mode Macro, accessible in the USB Mode community space. Recommend upgrading to USB Mode Version 2 when possible.
- Macro 2-2-10: USB Mode Version 2
