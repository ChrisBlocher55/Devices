## About

The USB Mode macro is a community driven solution that enables USB Passthrough for Cisco Room devices that do not nativley support this feature.

USB Passthrough is a feature, found on products like the Webex Room Kit Mini and the Webex Desk Pro, that allows you to take advantage the device's rich microphone(s), intelligent camera(s) and powerful speaker(s) as a sophisticated webcamera for various 3rd party software clients.

To better illustrate how this macro works, please click on the video demo below to see USB mode in action

## Before you begin
USB Mode is only 1 flavor of the USB Passthrough solution. Many new Room Devices support this nativley and we recommend you work with the native tools built into the product if available.

Check out the [USB Mode Endpoint Compatibility Matrix](#usb-mode-endpoint-compatibility-matrix) below to see which USB solution is right for you.

## Requirements
- A copy of the full deployment guide
- Compaitble Room Device either on
  - Latest stable software channel
  - Non-defered software release
- Admin Priveldges to your Room Device
- Ability to navigate the Macro Editor
- Compatible USB Capture Device

## How does the script work
USB Mode modify's your Room Devices base configuration in order to route your devices Selfview Video Feed and Microphone Audio data to a compatible USB capture card. Your system's base configuration is stored each time USB Mode is enabled in a separate script and is fully restored when disabling USB mode.

While USB mode is enabled, the Room Device is placed in an Infinite Do Not Disturb state,
