# Block Outgoing Calls

Block certain numbers in a reject list from being called from the system. Show a message on screen instead.

Open the macro in the macro editor and add more numbers to the list if you need to.

**NOTE**: If you are using this extension on Webex Edge, edit the macro and set the delay timeout to 5 seconds, otherwise the blocking will not take place.
