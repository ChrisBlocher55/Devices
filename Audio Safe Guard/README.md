# Learning: Audio safe guard
If user tries to adjust volume below a treshold you set, the macro automatically sets the volume back to the max limit.

This macro shows you how to:
- Listen to changes to the system (feedback on status)
- React to change and set values (command)
- Notify users about your macro (user interface alert)

Works on all devices.
